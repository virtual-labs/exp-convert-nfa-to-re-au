To demonstrate the conversion of a **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)** into an equivalent **Regular Expression (RE)** using state elimination, thereby illustrating their equivalence in formal language theory. This process is fundamental in applications such as lexical analyzer design, pattern matching, and compiler construction, where regular expressions are used to specify and recognize patterns efficiently.
