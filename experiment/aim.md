### Aim of the experiment
To demonstrate the process of converting a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into an equivalent Regular Expression (RE) by systematically eliminating states, thereby illustrating their equivalence in formal language theory. This conversion plays a key role in applications such as lexical analyzer design, pattern matching, and compiler construction, where regular expressions are used to define and recognize patterns efficiently.
