      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. NFAs are finite machines, not 'Non-Finite'.",
        "b": "Correct! NFA stands for Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton.",
        "c": "Incorrect. No such term in automata theory.",

      "question": "Why do we convert an NFA into a Regular Expression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To minimize the NFA",
        "b": "To optimize memory usage",
        "c": "To represent the accepted language concisely",
        "d": "To prove context-freeness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Minimization applies to DFAs, not NFA→RE conversion.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Memory optimization is not the purpose here.",
        "c": "Correct! Regular Expressions concisely describe the same language as the NFA.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Regular Expressions represent only regular languages, not context-free languages."

      "question": "In the State Elimination method, what happens at each step?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All transitions are deleted randomly",
        "b": "The start and final states are merged",
        "c": "One intermediate state is removed and transitions are updated",
        "d": "The alphabet is changed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Transitions are never discarded without replacement.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Start and final states must remain intact.",
        "c": "Correct! Each intermediate state is removed, updating transitions to preserve paths.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The alphabet symbols remain the same."

      "question": "Which states always remain in the NFA during the conversion process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All states with self-loops",

        "c": "States connected by epsilon transitions",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Self-loops can be collapsed during elimination.",
        "b": "Correct! Only the start and final states remain until the end.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Epsilon transitions are relevant in epsilon-closure, not for final preservation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Node degree doesn’t determine state preservation."

      "question": "Which method is commonly used to convert an NFA into a Regular Expression?",

        "a": "Incorrect. Subset Construction is used for NFA→DFA conversion.",
        "b": "Correct! The State Elimination Method is the standard method for NFA→RE conversion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Grammar derivation is not used here.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Cross Product is used to combine automata."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. DFAs appear in determinization, not in RE conversion.",
        "b": "Correct! The end result is a Regular Expression describing the same language.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Context-free grammars are used for non-regular languages.",
